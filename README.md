# Arduino-Wifi-Cancellation_and_Timer
Simple IoT connected arduino with meeting cancellation button and meeting time start/stop buttons. Useful for tracking meeting time to an online spreadsheet. The cancel function will send an email to all attendees of the next scheduled meeting that the meeting has been cancelled.
Unsure if Azure IoT Hub or other IOT service is better
